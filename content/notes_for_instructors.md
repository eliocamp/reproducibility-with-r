 # Notes for instructors

Would you like to teach this workshop/use the materials for your own course? We've compiled here a list of this we usually use while we teach. 

The check points are instances when we ask the students how familiar are with x topic. Depending on their answers we decide if we can skip the topic, explain a few things or going through it in depth. 

You will also find a template for the feedback form and the shared document.
