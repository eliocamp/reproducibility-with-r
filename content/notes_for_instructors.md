 # Notes for instructors

Would you like to teach this workshop/use the materials for your own course? We've compiled here a list of tools we usually use while we teach. 

The check points are instances when we ask the students how familiar are with x topic. Depending on their answers we decide if we can skip the topic, explain a few things or going through it in depth. 

While we are not very fans for slides, we realized people sometimes need them to know where they are in terms of content. They are also useful to show the check points/questions. So, we also have slides now.

You will also find a template for the feedback form and the shared document.
