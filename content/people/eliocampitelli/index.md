I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires in atmospheric sciences and an R package developer. I apply open science principles with a strong emphasis on reproducibility by publicly making all the code and data available. I'm a founding member of the R User Group in Buenos Aires and an outstanding contributor to the LatinR conference (as recognized by LatinR founding chairs). I maintain several open-source R packages (e.g., ggnewscale; metR) and contribute to other packages, such as data.table and ggplot2.
