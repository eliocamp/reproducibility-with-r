I have a PhD from the University of Buenos Aires. I study atmospheric sciences applying data assimilation techniques to improve short-term forecasts of severe events in Argentina. Also, I'm a Trainer and instructor for The Carpentries and an RStudio certified instructor. I'm also part of Expedition Science, an Argentina-based NPO, where she leads educational projects such as science camps and workshops for students and K-12 science teachers. I'm a professor at the Data Sciences degree and postgraduate courses at Guillermo Brown University.

I develops openly licensed materials to teach and learn R from scratch.
