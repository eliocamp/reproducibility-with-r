I'm a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires. I study atmospheric sciences applying data assimilation techniques to improve short-term forecasts of severe events in Argentina. Also, I'm a Trainer and instructor for The Carpentries and an RStudio certified instructor. I co-funded MetaDocencia, a Spanish-speaking community to help teachers and educator to apply science-based techniques to their clase.s

I develops openly licensed materials to teach and learn R from scratch.
