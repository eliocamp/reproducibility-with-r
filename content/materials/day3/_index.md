## Homework

<div class = "activity">

Initialise renv in your compendium

Use `renv::init()` to set up a lockfile and a local library for your project.
Make sure that you can run all the relevant code to ensure that renv has discovered all the dependencies correctly.

Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
Make sure that you don't commit the library folder.
