### Excersise 

#### Restore an environment

1. Download this reproducible project.

2. Open the project and run `renv::status()` in the R console. What’s the status of the packages?

3. Run `renv::restore()` in the R console and proceed.

4. Run `renv::status()` again to check that the project is in a consistent state.

5. Render analysis/report.Rmd to make sure that it worked.

## If you work with data, what’s the typical size?


😯 A few megabytes (less than 100 Mb per file).

👍 A lot of small files (more than 50 Gb in total).

👏 Chunky files (more than 100 Mb).
