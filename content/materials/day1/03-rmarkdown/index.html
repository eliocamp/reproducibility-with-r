<h2>RMarkdown files</h2>
<p>An RMarkdown file is a plain text file, with some rules and special syntax that allow us to write code and text together.
When it is “knited,” the code will be evaluated and executed and the text formatted so that it creates a reproducible report or document that is nice to read and contains all your work.</p>
<p>This is really critical to reproducibility.
It also saves us time and can help with automation tasks.
This document will recreate the figures for you in the same document where you are writing the text that explain them.
This will save you the effort of doing some analysis, saving a plot on a file, copy-pasting that plot into Word, LaTex or Power Point or Google Slides, and having to do it all over again after discovering a typo.</p>
<p>Now let’s create a new RMarkdown file.
In RStudio you can use the menu bar:</p>
<div class="instructions">
<p>File → New File → R Markdown</p>
</div>
<p>A new window will open where you can <em>optionaly</em> complete with your name, author and the output format.
Let try first HTML.
By doing click on th ok button, the new file will open showing the template.
This is great, you can try to “knit” the file to see the output document.</p>
<div class="activity">
<p>Your turn</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a new RMarkdown file.
You can choose the output format.</p></li>
<li><p>Knit the document.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the “source file” with the “output file”.
Can you identify the different sections of the file?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="file-structure" class="section level3">
<h3>File structure</h3>
<p>Any .Rmd file will have 3 sections or areas:</p>
<p><img src="img/markdown-knit.png" alt="Rmarkdown file in the left. Knited document on the right. The YAML, chunk codes and text areas are highlighted on the file."/></p>
<ul>
<li>The top part uses YAML sintaxis and includes the title and the output type (which in this case is an HTML document).</li>
<li>Below that there are alternating <em>white</em> and <em>grey</em> sections. These are the two main sections that make up an RMarkdown file: * Grey sections are code chunks. They are usually R chunks but there are many languages suported. * White sections are text sections and support markdown for styling.</li>
</ul>
<div id="header" class="section level4">
<h4>Header</h4>
<p>The header is a series of instructions organized between three dashes (<code>---</code>) that define the global properties of the document, such as the title, the output format, authorship information, etc.
The heather will contain many many more options when you use templates and customised reports.
You can aslo change options associated with the output format, such as the style of the table of contents or index.</p>
<p>The YAML format allows you to define hierarchical lists in a humanly readable way.
For example:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>---
title: &quot;Mi primer RMarkdown&quot;
output: 
  html_document:
    code_download: true
    toc: true
    toc_float: false
---</code></pre>
<div class="notes">
<p>Keep in mind the indentation!</p>
<p>It is very important to maintain the identation of the elements, since it defines the hierarchy of each element.
Many of the errors you’ll find when knitting occur because the file has problems in the header identation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="code-chunks" class="section level4">
<h4>Code chunks</h4>
<p>The R code is written inside code “chunks”.
Code chunks start with <code>```{r label}</code> (where “label” is an optional and unique name) and end with <code>```</code>.
Everything you include between these delimiters will be interpreted by R as code and will try to execute it when the file is knited.
Any output (graphics, tables, text, etc.) will be inserted into the final document in the same order as they are in the R Markdown file.</p>
<div class="instructions">
<p>You can create a new chunk with:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The “+C” green bottom on the top right of the document</li>
<li>A very handy shortcut: <code>Ctrl + Alt + I</code></li>
<li>Writing the ``` by hand (but why would you?)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>While the code will run when you knit, if you are analysing data and writing a report it is very convenient to run individual chunks interactively as if it were in the console.</p>
<p>To run the line where your cursor is use the shortcut:</p>
<div class="instructions">
<p>Ctrl + Enter</p>
</div>
<p>But you can also run the code of the whole chunk with:</p>
<div class="instructions">
<p>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</p>
</div>
<p>By default, the output will appear immediately below the block.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="markdown-text" class="section level3">
<h3>Markdown text</h3>
<p>You can get a guide to rmarkdown <a href="add%20link">in this</a> cheat sheet, but here is a minimum syntax to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>headers start with <code>#</code>or <code>##</code>and so on (it’s important to put a space after the last <code>#</code>).</li>
<li>bold words are surrounded with <code>**</code></li>
<li>and italics, with <code>_</code></li>
</ul>
