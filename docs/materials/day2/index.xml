      <description>Why git? Do you have something like this in your computer?

Git came to solve this problem. It is a version control system, that manage the evolution and changes of a set of files or repository. If you ever looked at the history of a Google Docs file, it is like that but in a very controlled way.</description>

      <title>02: Research compendia with rrtools</title>

      <description>Of course, you can always create a file structure that suit you and your work by hand. But here we are going to try rrtools to create a “research compendium” and combine it with the things we learned on the git and GitHub section.
The first thing you need to know is that an rrtools compendium will be at the same time an R package. If you don’t have experience with R packages, don’t worry!</description>

      <title>03: Sharing data</title>

      <description>The two ingredients for a reproducible project are code and data. We talked a lot about how to organise and share code, but what about data? Sharing data is far from trivial and there are a lot of things to consider.
Permissions Before the technical issues of sharing data there are the bureaucratic issues. Depending on your context, you might not be allowed to share your data. Data can be expensive to create so your company or institution might want to keep it private so they can squeeze all the profit it can from it.</description>
