      <description>While renv is nice, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the whole problem, because system dependencies and even the R version itself can change. Another issue is that downloading and installing all the R packages can take a while. Like an hour or more. This is not a deal-breaker, but it&#39; be great to do better. People trying to reproduce work are few and far between, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to make their lives as easy as possible.</description>
